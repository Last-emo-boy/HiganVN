Phase 1 – Editing & Validation
- [ ] Implement VNS syntax highlighter (ops, args, strings, comments)
- [ ] Add Problems panel; show diagnostics from parser
- [ ] Outline panel: labels, jumps, choices
- [ ] Export command to `editor/out/` (non-destructive)

Phase 2 – Assets & Graph
- [ ] Assets panel: browse `assets/<namespace>` with filters (bg, ch, bgm, se)
- [ ] Graph view: build nodes/edges from Program; click to navigate
- [ ] Inspector: edit op arguments with form widgets

Phase 3 – Preview & Tools
- [ ] Headless preview snapshot for current line
- [ ] External Run in pygame at cursor/IP
